## About the Project

The Book Search Engine is a web-based application built using modern web development technologies. It provides the following features:

- **Search for Books:** Users can search for books using keywords, and the application fetches data from the Google Books API to display search results.

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in to the application. User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure access to user-specific features.

- **Saved Books:** Authenticated users can save their favorite books to their profile. They can also remove books from their saved collection.

- **GraphQL:** The application uses GraphQL for querying and manipulating data. GraphQL queries and mutations are defined in the schema and resolvers.

- **Responsive Design:** The user interface is responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
